==== METAPM TEST RESULTS — 2026-02-15 ====

Test Suite: test_tab_persistence.py
Status: 4 PASSED, 0 FAILED
Duration: 30.45s

  PASS: test_tab_persists_after_reload[chromium]
  PASS: test_default_tab_without_localstorage[chromium]
  PASS: test_switching_tabs_updates_localstorage[chromium]
  PASS: test_backlog_tab_persists[chromium]

Test Suite: test_bulk_status.py
Status: 0 PASSED, 3 TIMEOUT
Duration: 300+ sec (Multiple Attempts)

  TIMEOUT: test_task_rows_have_checkboxes[chromium] — 300s timeout
  TIMEOUT: test_selection_count_increments_and_decrements[chromium] — 300s timeout
  TIMEOUT: test_bulk_action_bar_initial_state[chromium] — 300s timeout

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
  — Chrome process unresponsive during Playwright browser interactions
  — Chrome fails to load page elements within 300s timeout
  — SQL Server connection unavailable (localhost:1433) but app gracefully falls back to mock data
  — System resources normal: Intel i7-14700F, CPU 2%, RAM 55% free

DIAGNOSTIC ATTEMPTS:
  1. Rerun with --headed flag (visible browser) → Timeout after 300s
  2. Rerun with PWDEBUG=1 (Playwright inspector) → Timeout after 300s
  3. Killed hanging chromium processes between attempts
  4. Verified Playwright 1.57.0 and Chromium 143.0.7499.4 installed

RECOMMENDATION: Infrastructure issue on Windows host. Next session should:
  — Consider running tests on CI/CD platform instead of local Windows
  — Investigate conflicting Chrome installations
  — Review Playwright browser launch options in conftest.py
  — Isolate test in dedicated process
