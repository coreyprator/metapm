## Summary

The v1.9.5 fix for UAT submit (commit `16709bd`) was committed but the version bump was missing and deployment was never run. Fixed and deployed.

---

## Root Cause

Previous handoff said v1.9.5 was deployed with revision `metapm-v2-00038-dcw`, but:
- Health check showed v1.9.4
- `api_key_configured: false` (should be true)
- VERSION in config.py was still "1.9.4"

---

## Fix Applied

1. Updated `app/core/config.py` VERSION to "1.9.5"
2. Committed: `2b9e6cd`
3. Deployed to Cloud Run: revision `metapm-v2-00039-wsj`

## Verification

**Direct Cloud Run URL (works immediately):**
```bash
curl -s "https://metapm-v2-57478301787.us-central1.run.app/mcp/health"
# {"status":"healthy","service":"mcp","version":"1.9.5","api_key_configured":true}
```

**Test UAT Submit:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://metapm-v2-57478301787.us-central1.run.app/mcp/uat/submit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"failed","total_tests":12,"passed":5,"failed":7,"results_text":"TEST","project":"Test","version":"1.0"}'
```

**Stored Content (v1.9.5 format):**
```
**Status**: failed
**Tests**: 5 passed, 7 failed (out of 12 total)
```

## Custom Domain Note

The custom domain `metapm.rentyourcio.com` may show v1.9.4 due to CDN/DNS caching. The direct Cloud Run URL confirms v1.9.5 is deployed and working.

Use the direct URL for UAT Template submissions until cache clears:
`https://metapm-v2-57478301787.us-central1.run.app/mcp/uat/submit`
