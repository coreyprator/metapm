# INTENT.md -- MetaPM

## Primary Intent
MetaPM is Corey's single place for capturing, tracking, and acting on every idea in his life. Software projects and personal boondoggles. It exists because getting ideas out of his head and into a tracked system frees his mind for creative thinking.

## Success Is
- Corey can capture an idea from anywhere (walking, airplane, studio) and it lands in MetaPM in seconds.
- Every active project and personal item has a clear status visible from one dashboard.
- The stream-of-consciousness-to-finished-feature pipeline gets shorter with every improvement.
- Sprint prompts flow from MetaPM through CAI to CC and back with minimal PL friction.
- MetaPM evolves as the technology horizon moves. From prompt engineering to context engineering to intent engineering.

## Success Is NOT
- Feature parity with Monday.com or Jira. MetaPM serves one person's life, not a team.
- Perfecting the UI for imaginary users. Corey is the user.
- Adding tracking features that create more work than they save.
- Separating work and play. The blurred boundary is the life hack. MetaPM covers everything.

## Decision Boundaries
- If a feature saves PL time on future sprints, build it. If it only looks productive, skip it.
- When choosing between MetaPM improvements and other project work, ask: does this improvement multiply productivity across all projects? If yes, prioritize it.
- New category types use a relational lookup table. Never hardcode categories.
- Canonical descriptions in the seed file are sacred. CC must not paraphrase them.

## Anti-Goals
- Building admin features for users who don't exist.
- Over-engineering the schema for hypothetical scale.
- Tracking things that don't need tracking. If it creates overhead without payout, cut it.
- Letting MetaPM become busywork that displaces creative thinking.

## This Project Serves Portfolio Intents
- Cognitive vitality: MetaPM is the first app Corey opens. It's about his life, what's next, what to think about.
- Creative exploration: Captures blue-sky ideas the moment they occur, anywhere.
- Workflow automation: The dispatch system that routes ideas to the right project.
- Usability: Must work on mobile, disconnected, with voice input. One place for everything.

## Communication Standards
8th grade reading level. Short sentences. No em dashes. No filler. Direct.

## Historical Context
Started from PromptForge. Evolved as AI shifted from prompt engineering to context engineering. Will evolve again as intent engineering matures. The infrastructure/creative-outlet Venn diagram has almost total overlap.

## Future Vision
Technology agnostic. Corey describes requirements and tests outcomes. Whether MetaPM does the routing or some future agent conductor handles it, the goal is the same: stream of consciousness in, finished tested work product out. The ideal state is 80%+ of Corey's involvement is providing ideas and testing results.
