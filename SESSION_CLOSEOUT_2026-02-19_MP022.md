## 1. WHAT WAS DONE

### MP-022a: Edit Modal for All Entity Types ✅

- **Projects**: ✏️ edit icon in project-head. Opens addModal in editMode (state.editMode=true, state.editId). Fields: name, emoji, version, status, repo_url. Code is read-only. PUT /api/roadmap/projects/{id}.
- **Sprints**: ✏️ edit icon in sprint bucket-title. Fields: project, name, status. PUT /api/roadmap/sprints/{id}.
- **Requirements**: Existing drawer already handles editing (title, priority, type, status, description, sprint, target_version). Title input confirmed working (v2.2.2+).
- Single addModal is re-used for Add and Edit modes. `state.editMode` toggle switches POST→PUT and pre-populates fields.

### MP-022b: Delete All Entity Types ✅

**Backend:**
- `DELETE /api/roadmap/projects/{id}` — added to roadmap.py lines 178-200. Returns 409 if project has requirements (FK guard).
- `DELETE /api/roadmap/sprints/{id}` — added to roadmap.py lines 354-365.
- `DELETE /api/roadmap/requirements/{id}` — already existed; confirmed working.

**Frontend:**
- 🗑 Delete button in requirement drawer (calls `deleteRequirement()` with confirm dialog).
- 🗑 Delete Project button inside project edit modal (calls `deleteEntity('projects', id, name)`).
- 🗑 Delete Sprint button inside sprint edit modal.
- All deletes require `confirm()` dialog. showToast() confirms success.

### MP-022c: Requirement Code Visible ✅

- `data-searchable` attribute added to all req rows containing: `code title type priority status project_name`.
- Code was already shown as `<strong>${req.code}</strong>` badge in rowHtml (from v2.2.2).

### MP-022d: Full-Text Search ✅

- Search box added to controls bar (next to Expand All button).
- `filterDashboard(query)` function: filters req rows by `data-searchable` attribute. Hides project sections that have no visible reqs and don't match by project name.
- Instant client-side filter — no backend call.

## 5. FILES CHANGED

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app/api/roadmap.py` | +35 lines: DELETE /projects/{id} (with FK guard) and DELETE /sprints/{id} |
| `static/dashboard.html` | +176 lines: CSS (.del-btn, .edit-icon, .toast), search box, drawer 🗑 button, state (editMode/editId), rowHtml (data-searchable), render() (project-head ✏️ icon, sprint bucket ✏️ icon), bindHierarchyEvents (edit icon handlers), saveAdd (editMode branch), bindControls (search+delReq), openEdit(), deleteEntity(), deleteRequirement(), showToast(), filterDashboard(), escHtml() |
| `app/core/config.py` | VERSION 2.2.2 → 2.3.0 |

**Dashboard:** 652 → 828 lines. Not rewritten; additive changes only.

---

## 6. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- **Project edit doesn't update `code` field**: Code is read-only in edit modal (PK-like value, shouldn't be changed casually).
- **Browser-only UAT items pending**: Items 9-12 above require PL to open the dashboard and verify.
- **Delete project blocked if has requirements**: Correct behavior (FK guard returns 409). PL must delete requirements before project.
